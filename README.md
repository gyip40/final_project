Period: 1
Group members: Gloria Yip
Group name: Boba Enthusiast

Project title: Boba Shop

Project description:
Players receive 3 orders and push buttons to complete them and get a score based on their completion time.
Current functionalities:
Home screen
Dialogue script
Boba simulator with buttons and graphics
Score tracker

How it works:
You start by pressing the bell. Then, you can hit the arrow buttons and press ‘ENTER’ to choose to start (by picking yes) or to go back to the home screen (by picking no). Once you start, you’re prompted to type in your name. If you leave this field blank, the game will address you by “Mysterious Person.” Press ‘ENTER’ or click your mouse to make the dialogue continue. After that, you will start making your first boba. Note that this is Order #0, which is considered a practice and not counted towards your overall score. When you finish pressing the corresponding buttons to the order, your score will be shown on screen. Press ‘CONTINUE’ to cue dialogue #2. Pressing on the order on the counter will give you another boba to make. When you finish Order #3, the game will thank you for playing and tell you your total score.
